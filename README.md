### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  My name is Leonardo, I`m 27 years old. \n
  I was born in Botucatu, SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Medical Physics from the SÃ£o Paulo State University "JÃºlio de Mesquita Filho" (UNESP) at the Botucatu Biosciences Institute. My undergraduate research project was fully developed in back-end programming using the Python language, specifically with the help of the Jupyter Notebook platform. I am a practical, calm, observant, multifunctional, and relaxed person, but these are only a few of my main professional traits. \n
  I have previously worked as a sales clerk at a local store, taught English at a pre-university course, and served as a content creator for an international live-streaming platform. When envisioning the professional milieu in which I see myself, I identify as someone who resolves conflicts and delivers practical results. Organizational skills, efficiency, punctuality, and commitment are among my most valuable qualities in a corporate setting. \n
  I have been developing and applying myself specifically in the field of information technology, an area that arouses great interest in me, especially after I first studied a Microsoft Power BI course. Since then, I have been dedicating myself intensively and seeking job offers in this area in order to enhance my knowledge and pursue a career in the technological industry.
  Hope we get to work along. \n
